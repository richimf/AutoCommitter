# AutoCommiter

Features:

[X] Automatic Branching name with a "prefix", such as: 

> feature/Branch/[Id-Branch]_Branch_Name


[X] Add a "prefix" text in every commit, for example:

> [ID-1234][BugFix][Ticket12] Commit description.

So user just only worry about writting the *Commit description*, not the whole "prefix".
